# kafka-sync

A simple POC project to simulate various aspects of managing data sync with Kafka.

## How to Run

The `kafka-sync.sh` script handles everything for running Kafka, the producer app, the consumer app, and all related resources.

Kafka-UI is configured here and will run on port 8080.

The producer & consumer application have IntelliJ HTTP Client requests ready to go for testing.
